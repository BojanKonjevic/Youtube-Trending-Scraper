# YouTube Trending Scraper

This Python script uses Selenium and WebDriver to scrape trending YouTube videos. The program extracts video data such as title, channel name, view count, publication date, and video link, and saves the results in both Excel and JSON formats.

## Features

- **Scrapes YouTube Trending**: The script navigates to the YouTube trending page and extracts information on videos.
- **Extracts Data**: Includes video title, channel name, view count, publication date, video link, and thumbnail.
- **Scrolls to Load All Videos**: Automatically scrolls the page to load all trending videos.
- **Outputs to Excel and JSON**: Saves the scraped data to an Excel file (`.xlsx`) and a JSON file (`.json`).
- **Headless Browser Support**: Can run without a browser window using headless mode.
